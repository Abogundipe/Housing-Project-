# Housing-Project-

We would be working with the "apartments.csv" dataset, which includes detailed listings of apartments. Each listing features the rental price, square footage, geographic coordinates, and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, among other attributes. The task involves three main objectives:

Data Cleaning: Begin by sanitizing the dataset. Ensure all numerical fields contain only valid numbers and remove any non-conforming entries or anomalies.

Data Analysis: Next, apply various data analysis techniques to extract insights from the data, with a focus on understanding the factors that influence rental prices.

Data Visualization: Create charts and graphs that display the relationships you've identified in the data.
